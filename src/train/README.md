This folder contains training code and evaluation scripts for my local AI billiards project. Please note that all code may be different from the original code provided by the course.

Especially agents code are modified heavily to add better type hints and docstrings for clarity.

The key `evaluate.py` and `poolenv.py` files try to reduce the amount for code change so later adaption to actual submission version of code for evaluation would be easier.
